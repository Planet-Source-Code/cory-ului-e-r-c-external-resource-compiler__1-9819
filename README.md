## E\.R\.C \- External Resource Compiler


</div>

### Description

Compiles External Resource Files.

Lets say u have 10 files in a external resource file. You want to extract just one, ezy. Soon I will add a peice of code that lets u extract it to memory rather then to a new file/then to memory. but I'm reaaaal busy, so it will be a while. (you probably' can figure it out. but still :) ....)

I was in such a rush, theres alittle I have to had. Check back in awhile. (I am busy it takes along "while"). I dunno even if it works. Justkidding, sure it works. But it was rushed. There is no comments in this sorry. But I may add them.
 
### More Info
 
Compiled Resource File Maybe???

No sure, I hope not!
